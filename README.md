a Streamlit-based pet triage assistant called FetchCare.ai, where users can manage multiple pets, track their symptoms (meals, poop, swelling, weight), and chat with a compassionate AI named Pip. The assistant does not diagnose but gently guides owners on whether vet care might be needed, adhering to the Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1966. The app includes chat history per pet, multi-pet support, new chat sessions, animated typing feedback, and Firestore integration for persistent storage.
